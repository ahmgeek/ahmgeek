# Open for SRE roles
Hey everyone,
I'm officially open to new opportunities as a Site Reliability Engineer â€” remote only. Iâ€™ve been professionally building software for over 10 years, working across backend, cloud infrastructure, and SRE roles.

Iâ€™ve done it all â€” monitoring (Prometheus, Thanos), dashboards, K8s, cluster rebuilds, deployment pipelines, automation, and more.
Iâ€™ve contributed to teams at [GitLab](https://github.com/gitlabhq), [Runtastic](https://www.runtastic.com), and [ErsteBank](https://www.erstegroup.com/en/home), helping build scalable systems, maintain uptime, and keep things smooth in production.
My last role was a short one (just two months) â€” a mutual mismatch that we decided to end early.

Now Iâ€™m ready for the next great thing. Iâ€™m open to full-time remote roles, and Iâ€™m also available for contracting or consulting work in the meantime.

If you or someone you know is looking for help in infra, backend, or reliability work, feel free to reach out: ðŸ“§ `tolba@hey.com`

Thanks for reading â€” happy to chat or help if I can!
